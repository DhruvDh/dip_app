## Image Kernel to be used

Write the image kernel you want to use in this demo in the following text box.

The syntax is as follows -
- All numbers you enter should be floating point numbers, like so - `1.0`.
- Arrays start and end with square brackets; individual elements are separated by commas, like so - `[a, b]`.
- And an image kernel is -
  - Either a python list of lists like - `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`
  - Or a list where the beginning of a new row is marked by a semicolon, like so - `[1, 2; 3, 4]`
- There are a bunch of kernel matrices written in this format on a table near the end of this page for you to copy and try out. (like `[ [-1.0, -1.0, -1.0], [-1.0, 8.0, -1.0], [-1.0, -1.0, -1.0] ]`)
